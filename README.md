Worthie - Personal Finance Tracker(Working Title)



I have tracked all income and expenses for 10 years on a spreadsheet. Combined with services like Mint or Personal Capital, updating my personal balance sheet monthly and adding income and expenses every few days has allowed me to keep a watchful eye on my savings and net worth. Although I have never used them, I'm assuming this is similar to You Need a Budget(YNAB) or some QuickBooks/Intuit Personal Finance product,but it will be mine and a great full-stack project.

This ongoing project is planned to bring together the following technologies.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript

React - Front End interaction, states flowing in the following order

Year > Month(Including Year-to-Date) > (Income || Expense || Investment || ) > Each Individual Spreadsheet

Income/Expense/Investment Navbar to include Dashboard tab. Dashboard will/can show summary based on month and YTD, numbers and hopefully implement a graph of some sort for easy trend and visual appeal.

Spreadsheet component - A library similar to UI Grid, as UI Grid is Angular, may use React Spreadsheet or other library upon testing.

SQL Database - Users with logins, saved data from user input. 

Back-End - Whatever technology is necessary to interact with the SQL Database, Node.JS or Express?
